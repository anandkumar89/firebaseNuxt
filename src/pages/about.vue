            Hi, I am a structural engineer, an amature photographer and chef by weekend. A mood-based-music, coffee and python is my favorite boredom-killer. 
            More often than not, I sits long reflecting upon education and research in more philosophical way - and other topics that puzzles my mind. 
            This blog is by product of what comes out of those moments of epiphany. 
            
            <br/>
            I've formally obtained a degree in structural engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur and am pursuing further research at IIT Bombay after a brief period of corporate exposure of 9 months.</div>
